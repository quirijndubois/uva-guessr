# UvA guesser
## A fun game where you guess which UvA lecture room you are located in. Inspired by Geoguessr

Right now you can only look arount a random uva room from the short list. I'm working on actual gameplay. Stay tuned. 

I'll try to host it somewhere and make it public as soon as possible. But for now get started by running the image_download.py. This script downloads the panorama images of all uva rooms in rooms.txt from https://rooster.uva.nl. The reason for this solution is that i dont actually want to host UvA's imagery directly, since it might be copyrighted (idk) Then just open the index.html to play. If you read this and want to contribute, please just add some rooms to the rooms.txt. For now this is a bit tedious, because you have to manually check if each room exists and has panorama images on the https://rooster.uva.nl
